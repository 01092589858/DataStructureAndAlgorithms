# Data Structure and Algorithms analysis - Job Interview
In this course you will learn how to Analysis algorithms like Sorting algorithms ( Bubble, Merge, Heap, and quick sort) , searching algorithms ( Binary search, linear search, and Interpolation), Graph algorithms( Binary tree, DFS, BFS, Nearest Neighbor and Shortest path, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Algorithm) And how to reduce the code complexity from one Big-O  level to another level. Furthermore, you will learn different Data Structure like Dynamic Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Hash-Table, Also you will learn how to find Big-O for every data structure, and how to apply  correct Data Structure to your problem in Java. Be the end you will be able to write code that run faster and use low memory. You Also will learn  how to analysis problem using Dynamic programming
